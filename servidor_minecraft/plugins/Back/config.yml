# If you believe is a lot, you can't just remove the spaces here in the config.yml, so only 1 space will be visible above and under in game.
# If you want to add more information, you can change or add more lines.

# This option can be only be enabled if your server version is 1.16 or above. If the option is
# activated and your server is below 1.16, some logs will be sent into the Console each time
# the command is used. To stop, disable the option and use the /back reload

# For a better explanation, please check the Back Overview Page at spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/back.94702/
